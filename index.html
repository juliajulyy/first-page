       		A programmer, developer, dev, coder, or software engineer is a person who creates computer software. The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers or to a generalist <strong>who writes code</strong> for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst.

					Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, <em>the first computer program is generally dated to 1843</em>, when mathematician 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>'s Analytical Engine. Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.

				<h2 class="item">Quotes about programming.</h2>
				<blockquote>
					The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language.
				</blockquote>
				<cite>Alan Kay</cite>
				<blockquote>
					Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
				</blockquote>
				<cite>Brian Kernighan</cite>
				<blockquote>
					Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about programs without thinking of them as pieces of executable code. 
				</blockquote>
				<cite>Edsger W. Dijkstra</cite>
				<blockquote>
					The really good programmers spend a lot of time programming. I haven’t seen very good programmers who don’t spend a lot of time programming. If I don’t program for two or three days, I need to do it. And you get better at it—you get quicker at it. The side effect of writing all this other stuff is that when you get to doing ordinary problems, you can do them very quickly.
				</blockquote>
				<cite>Joe Armstrong</cite>
				<blockquote>
					If you can write "hello world" you can change the world.
				</blockquote>
